    "# PostgreSQL Database Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to use gathered data to create a PostgreSQL database of information for the years 1998-2016. The included tables should include (this list may expand with time):\n",
    "\n",
    "* People (from Lahman DB)\n",
    "* Batting (from Lahman DB)\n",
    "* Pitching (from Lahman DB)\n",
    "* Salary (from Lahman DB)\n",
    "* Appearances (from Lahman DB)\n",
    "* Team data (from Lahman DB)\n",
    "* Payrolls (scraped from The Baseball Cube)\n",
    "* Team WAR by Position (scraped from Fangraphs)\n",
    "* Free Agent Data (scraped from Baseball Reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Clarification on Date:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When I say a year (e.g. \"1998\"), what I mean is that the free agents are those immediately AFTER that season. So for instance, the \"1998\" data should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Player's stats for the 1998 season\n",
    "* Player's salary for the 1998 season\n",
    "* Team payroll data from the 1998 season\n",
    "* Team WAR by position for the 1998 season\n",
    "* Free agent information for the 1998 season\n",
    "\n",
    "We're then predicting where free agents will sign for the following season; so the above data would be used to predict free agent destinations for the 1999 season. Thus, the most recent season would be labeled \"2016\" and would be used to predict where free agents ended up for the 2017 season. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Data Limitations **\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to do 1998-2016 and not the other years. The 2 reasons are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can't do 2017 because it's not complete yet; we could certainly predict the destinations for every free agent (and maybe that'll be the final product??), but right now we can't use them for testing. So they're not in the test/train set\n",
    "\n",
    "* We shouldn't do pre-1998 because all of the teams weren't around until 1998, greatly affecting the environment. Furthermore, even though all the teams popped up in 1998, there was an expansion draft that really screwed everything up. So nothing pre-1998\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, we'll capture stats and whatnot INCLUDING 2017 so that we could predict for that year. No point in ignoring those data, we'll just have to screen them out when we pull data from the database later."
